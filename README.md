No that's actually the name.

## Catch the falling balls with the bar of the matching color.

Inspired by all the catcher games 🌠. The twist is that they change colors all the time. 🔴🟠🟡🟢🔵🟣🟤⚫⚪
The bars, the balls, spawn points, and trajectory are random.

### Modes:

- 😝 Easy (you get 2 random colors, more lives, and odds are weighted in your favor)
- 😭 Hard-ish (there's 5 colors to deal with and less chances)

## How to play 🎮

>1. Go to [livesite](https://ruvvet.github.io).
>2. Catch the falling balls that match the color of the bar w/ the `f` & `j` keys.
>3. Successfully catching a matching ball nets your +1 point.
>4. Failing to catch a matching ball costs -1 life.
>5. Beat your own high score, the more points you get, the more balls that spawn.
>6. The game is over when you lose all your lives.

# Code snippets

### Game state logic

Many variables control differnent asepcts of the game, but the gameState variable controls the overall flow of the user experience. Different states give different decision trees with the same user input. 

```javascript
let gameState = '';

// can be '' for no game in play
// can be 'play' for game is in play - continue to render + update
// can be 'pause for when it's paused, continues to render but does not update
// can be 'over' for when the game is finalized and we're prepping to reset + move on

```


### Creating classes for major objects, such as the falling balls/objects. And extending those classes so they have different behaviors.

The falling objects parent class was extended into 3 children classes: objects that fall from the left, objects that fall from the right, and the mega balls which are there to wreak havok.

```javascript
class Fallingthings {
  //need an extended class
  constructor(colorweight) {
    // random spawn location
    this.x = rand(game.width / 4, (game.width / 4) * 3);
    this.y = rand(0, game.height / 8);
    // initializes random color
    this.color = colors[rand(0, colors.length)];
    //...
    this.match = false;
    // controls if the ball is still in play or not
    this.alive = true;
    // controls if the ball was successfully caught
    this.caught = false;
    // controls if the ball is kept rendering even if 'dead'
    this.keeprendering = true;
  }

  //...

class FallingthingsL extends Fallingthings {
  constructor(catcherColor) {
    super();

    //...

class FallingthingsR extends Fallingthings {
  constructor(catcherColor) {
    super();

    //...

class FallingThingsMega extends Fallingthings {
  constructor() {
    super();

    //...

```


### Travel path, collision detection, render logic, motion trails, and more.

Functions for behavior and game logic for individual elements/instances are calculated using functions inside the parent/child classes.

```javascript
    //...

// creates the motion trail for the falling ball
lastPosition(x, y) {
    // called after the object is moved to a new position
    // saves it in the motion trail array
    // deletes the first element to constantly update
    this.motionTrailArr.push({ x: x, y: y });
    if (this.motionTrailArr.length > this.motionTrailLength) {
      this.motionTrailArr.shift();
    }
  }

// dictates how it will fall and react with other objects
fall(timeMultiplier) {
    this.lastPosition(this.x, this.y);
    this.speedY += this.gravity * timeMultiplier;
    this.y += this.speedY + this.gravitySpeed;
    // determines the trajectory at which objects will fall
    this.x +=
      this.direction *
      Math.sqrt((this.y - game.height) / -this.slope) *
      timeMultiplier;
    // determines if the ball will bounce
      this.bounceObj();
    }
    // determines if the ball continue to be rendered
    if (this.y > game.height || this.x > game.width || this.x < 0) {
      hit.play();
      this.keeprendering = false;
    }
  }

```

### Using setTimeout to simulate random events

Using a random setTimeout to call a new spawn, and then recursively calling itself with a random setTImeout range.

```javascript
// after initial call of spawn
  function spawnMega() {
      // we create the new instance
    megaArray.push(new FallingThingsMega(colorweight));
    setTimeout(function () {
      for (mega of megaArray) {
        mega.keeprendering = false;
        mega.alive = false;
      }
      megaArray.shift();
      //mega.keeprendering = false;
    }, 20000);

    //then set a random timeout
    // for the next time we call the function again
    setTimeout(function () {
      spawnMega();
    }, rand(20000, 40000));
  }
```

### Primary game loop

Based on the current gamestate, this function renders, updates, and then calls the next frame to be painted.

```javascript
function gameLoop(now) {

  timePassed = (now - lastLoop) / 1000;
  lastLoop = now;

  if (gameState == 'pause') {
    pauseMessage();
    requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop); // continue rendering even if paused
  } else if (gameState == 'over') {
    // game is over
    // save local high score
    if (score > highScore) {
      localStorage.setItem('highScore', score);
      highScore = localStorage.getItem('highScore');
    }
    gameOverMessage();
  } else {
    // continue updating and rendering with each gameloop, then recusively callback
    updateFallingThings(timePassed);
    render();
    requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
  }
}

```

| `changeColor()`   | (Catcher class) - changes its color. |

| `spawnL()`, `spawnR()`, `megaSpawn()`, `colorSwapL()`, `colorSwapR()` | Creates a new instances of the class and pushes it into the array. Sets a random timeout for the next time it will be called |
| `render()` | Not in a class, handles what's rendered on canvas at each loop|
| `upddateFallingThings()`| Checks the state of each object in play and updates it to be rendered properly|
